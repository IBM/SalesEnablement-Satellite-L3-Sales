Welcome to the IBM Cloud Satellite Technology Sales Enablement Level 3 learning plan. The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM Sales and Technical Sales and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales the knowledge and tools to perform introductory demonstrations on IBM Cloud Satellite.

 There are 3 parts to this demonstration guide as seen in the left hand navigation:

 - Part 1 - IBM Cloud Satellite overview and provisioning
 - Part 2 - Deploy an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled service
 - Part 3 - Deploy an OpenShift application

To complete the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge requirements, IBM and Business Partners sellers must complete Parts 1 and 2 of this demonstration guide. **However, we strongly encourage sellers to complete all three sections.** The technical sales community must complete all three sections. The associated Learning Plan Stand and Deliver rubrics (IBMers) and quizzes (Business Partners) are based upon the sections required for the respective roles.

Each of these sections has detailed steps for demonstrating IBM Cloud Satellite. Click on each section name in the left hand navigation bar to expand the section.

In Part 1 and Part 2, you will see how the demonstration environment was built and how you can perform a "baking show" type of demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demos, or videos made available in this demonstration script. Note that you will not be deploying a new Satellite Location or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster, as these activities take a significant amount of time and resources (money).

In Part 3, you will use the IBM Cloud Portal to complete the deployment of a cloud native application. This section provides a compelling demonstration to potential clients.

!!! tip

    You can also leverage the IBM Cloud Satellite collection <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/SetupIBMCloudSatelliteLocationInAWS" target="_blank">here</a> for longer client demonstrations or proof-of-concepts. Be aware, additional provisioning time and manual configurations are required.  Refer to the documentation in the collection.

## Helpful tips for using this demonstration environment

This demonstration script is organized in parts and chapters. Most chapters contain numbered steps, which are actions that you will perform.

Throughout the lab, you will see images that are examples of what you should be seeing in the IBM Cloud Portal, IBM Cloud Shell, and Red Hat OpenShift web console. In some instances, you will see the following styles of highlighting in those images:

- Action highlight box: Illustrates where you should click,  enter, or select an item:
