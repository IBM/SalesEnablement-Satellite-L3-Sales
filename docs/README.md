Welcome to the IBM Cloud Satellite Technology Sales Enablement Level 3 learning plan. The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner sellers and technical sellers the knowledge and tools to perform introductory demonstrations on IBM Cloud Satellite.

 There are 4 parts to this demonstration guide as seen in the left hand navigation:

 - Part 1 - IBM Cloud Satellite overview
 - Part 2 - Deploy an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled service
 - Part 3 - Deploy an OpenShift application

To complete the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge requirements, IBM and Business Partners sellers must complete Parts 1 and 2 of this demonstration guide. **However, we strongly encourage sellers to complete all three sections.** The technical sales community must complete all three sections. The associated Learning Plan stand and deliver rubrics (IBMers) and quizzes (Business Partners) will be based upon the sections required for their respective roles.

Each of these sections has detailed steps for demonstrating IBM Cloud Satellite. Click on each section name in the left hand navigation bar to expand the section. In Part 1 and Part 2, you will see how the demonstration environment was built and how you can perform a "baking show" type of demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demos, or videos made available in this demonstration script. Be aware, you will not  be deploying a new Satellite Location or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster, as these activities take a significant amount of time and resources (money). In Part 3, you will use the IBM Cloud Portal to complete the deployment of a cloud native application. This section provides a compelling demonstration to potential clients.

To complete your {{ learningplan.name }} training, you must complete each of the sections. When done, return to the Your Learning plan (<a href="{{ learningplan.url }}" target="_blank">{{ learningplan.url }}</a>), and mark this activity complete.

You can also leverage the IBM Cloud Satellite collection <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/SetupIBMCloudSatelliteLocationInAWS" target="_blank">here</a> for longer client demonstrations or proof-of-concepts. Be aware, additional provisioning time and manual configurations are required.  Refer to the documentation in the collection.

## Helpful tips for using this demonstration environment

This demonstration script is organized in parts and chapters. Most chapters contain numbered steps, which are typically actions that you will perform.

Throughout the lab, you will see images that are examples of what you should be seeing in the IBM Cloud Portal, IBM Cloud Shell, and Red Hat OpenShift web console. In some instances, you will see the following styles of highlighting in those images:

- Action highlight box: Illustrates where you should click,  enter, or select an item:

- Path/explore highlight box: Illustrates one of two things:

  - the path to follow to get to a specific location in the user interface
  - areas to explore on your own

- Copy to clipboard box: Text that is copied to your clipboard. Click the copy icon (highlighted below) and then paste using your operating systems paste function, for example, entering ++ctrl++**+v**, ++cmd++**+v**, or right click and select paste.

Additionally, there are several "click-thru" demonstrations.  These will appear like the static image below.

It is recommended you open the "click-thru" demonstration in a new browser window in full screen mode.  The methods to do this depends on the browser you are using:

- Firefox: right click on the image, from the context menu that pops up, select "This Frame -> Open Frame in New Window"
- Safari: right click on the image, from the context menu that pops up, select "Open Frame in New Window"
- Chrome: right click on the white boarder of the image, from the context menu that pops up, select "View Frame Source", remove the string "view-source" from the new tab's URL

Next, click the play button ![](_attachments/ClickThruPlayButton.png) in the middle of the screen. Then, simply follow the steps in the demonstration guide.  If at any point you are unsure where to click, simply click anywhere on the screen and a highlight box will appear showing where to click next.
