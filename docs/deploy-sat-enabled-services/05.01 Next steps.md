    IBM and Business Partner sellers can stop at this point if you choose; however, we strongly encourage you to complete Part 3 as well.

If you stop here, be sure to return to Your Learning or IBM Training to complete the requirements for your badge.

    IBM and Business Partner technical sellers must complete Part 3 as that content will be part of the IBM technical sellers Stand and Deliver rubric and the Business Partner quiz for the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge.
