The next step is optional for client demonstrations.

Sometimes, updates need to be rolled back. This is achieved by reverting from the current **version** to a previous one. The steps are the same as those performed in the last exercise. In this case, edit the **frontend-on-prod-clusters** **subscription** and change from the **food-delivery-frontend-v2** **version** back to the **food-delivery-frontend-v1** **version**.

1. Open the IBM Cloud portal to the Configurations overview page: <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/configuration" target="_blank">https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/configuration</a>.

2. Click the **configuration** link based upon your **{{ tz_environment.uuid_label }}**.

3. Edit the **frontend-on-dev-clusters** Subscription.

4. Change the **version** for the **subscription** to use the **food-delivery-frontend-v1** and click **Save**.

5. Verify the **Rollout status** is updated.

6. Verify the original frontend has been re-deployed to the development environment.

You have now completed a rollback of the Food Delivery application.
