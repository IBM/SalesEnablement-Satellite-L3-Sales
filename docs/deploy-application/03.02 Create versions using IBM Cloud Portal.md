Now that the **configuration** has been created for you, the next step is to create **versions** for each part of the Food Delivery application. In this example, the YAML files used will create OpenShift deployments and routes in the namespace that has been created for you in the respective OpenShift clusters. Four **deployment** versions will be created: two for the backend services of the application and two different frontends. These **deployments** will deploy the Kubernetes containers that include the container images and application code. **Versions** will also be created for the development (dev) and production (prod) environments that will define **routes**. Routes are used in OpenShift to define communication paths between the end user and the frontend of the application, as well as from the frontend to the backend, and backend to the various backend data stores.

Almost all IBM Cloud capabilities can be performed using the IBM Cloud Portal, command line interfaces (CLIs), and application programming interfaces (APIs). In this demonstration, you will use two of these methods to create the **versions**. First, you will use the IBM Cloud Portal to create the first **version** that will deploy the backend database (Mongo and Redis) and event stream system (Kafka). Next, you will use the IBM Cloud command line interfaces (CLIs) to create the **versions** for the backend mirco-services, frontends applications, and the network routes that hook all the components together.

1. If you closed the IBM Cloud portal after the previous step, open the IBM Cloud portal to the Satellite Configurations page: <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/configuration" target="_blank">https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/configuration</a>.

2. Click the **configuration** based on your **{{ tz_environment.uuid_label }}**.

3. Click the **Versions** link in left hand menu.

!!! warning
    Notice, one **Version** already exists in your configuration. This **Version** was used to create the OpenShift project where you will be deploying the application. Do **NOT** delete any existing versions or subscriptions! Deleting them will break your demonstration environment.

4. Click **Add version +**.

5. Create a **version** called **kafka-mongo-redis**.

!!! info "Important"
    Do NOT click the **Add** button until AFTER you complete step 6!!!

For the Version name, use:

```
kafka-mongo-redis
```
!!! tip
    To save time, use click the ![](_attachments/CopyToClipboard.png) icon in the sections below to copy the text to your clipboard and then paste the text into the IBM Cloud portal as directed.

Optionally, enter a description in the **Description** field.

Copy and paste the following YAML code into the **YAML editor**.

6. Search and replace all instances of **{{ tz_environment.uuid_label }}** with your unique **{{ tz_environment.uuid_label }}**. The YAML editor in the IBM Cloud portal has a **search and replace** function. Type ++ctrl++**+f** or ++cmd++**+f** (this will vary depending on your computers operating system). Expand the dialog by clicking the ![](_attachments/expandIcon.png) icon next to the entry field. In the first entry field, enter **{{ tz_environment.uuid_label }}**. In the second entry field, enter your unique **{{ tz_environment.uuid_label }}**. The dialog should update with a **"1 of 6"** message. Click the **replace all** ![](_attachments/replaceAllicon.png) icon to make the changes.

7. Click **Add**.

??? failure "Is the **Add** button not enabled?"
    If the **Add** button isn't enabled, there is a problem with your YAML. YAML is very sensitive to formatting. Make sure you cut & paste the YAML instead of entering it manually.

Now that we have created a **version** using the IBM Cloud Portal, in the next section create the other **versions** using the IBM Cloud command line interfaces.  This will save time and illustrate how most clients will automate these steps.
