The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM Sales and Technical Sales and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales the knowledge and tools to perform introductory demonstrations on IBM Cloud Satellite. There are 3 parts to this demonstration guide as seen in the left hand navigation: Part 1 - IBM Cloud Satellite overview and provisioning Part 2 - Deploy an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled service Part 3 - Deploy an OpenShift application To complete the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge requirements, IBM and Business Partners sellers must complete Parts 1 and 2 of this demonstration guide. However, we strongly encourage sellers to complete all three sections. The technical sales community must complete all three sections. The associated Learning Plan Stand and Deliver rubrics (IBMers) and quizzes (Business Partners) are based upon the sections required for the respective roles. Each of these sections has detailed steps for demonstrating IBM Cloud Satellite. Click on each section name in the left hand navigation bar to expand the section. In Part 1 and Part 2, you will see how the demonstration environment was built and how you can perform a \"baking show\" type of demonstration using the IBM Cloud Portal, click-thru demos, or videos made available in this demonstration script. Note that you will not be deploying a new Satellite Location or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster, as these activities take a significant amount of time and resources (money). In Part 3, you will use the IBM Cloud Portal to complete the deployment of a cloud native application. This section provides a compelling demonstration to potential clients. Tip You can also leverage the IBM Cloud Satellite collection here for longer client demonstrations or proof-of-concepts. Be aware, additional provisioning time and manual configurations are required. Refer to the documentation in the collection. Helpful tips for using this demonstration environment This demonstration script is organized in parts and chapters. Most chapters contain numbered steps, which are actions that you will perform. Throughout the lab, you will see images that are examples of what you should be seeing in the IBM Cloud Portal, IBM Cloud Shell, and Red Hat OpenShift web console. In some instances, you will see the following styles of highlighting in those images: Action highlight box: Illustrates where you should click, enter, or select an item: Path/explore highlight box: Illustrates one of two things: the path to follow to get to a specific location in the user interface areas to explore on your own Copy to clipboard box: Text that is copied to your clipboard. Click the copy icon (highlighted below) and then paste using your operating systems paste function, for example, entering Ctrl +v , Cmd +v , or right click and select paste. Additionally, there are several \"click-thru\" demonstrations. These will appear like the static image below. It is recommended that you open the \"click-thru\" demonstration in a new browser window in full screen mode. The methods to do this depend on the browser you are using: Firefox: right click on the image, from the context menu that pops up, select \"This Frame -> Open Frame in New Window\" Safari: right click on the image, from the context menu that pops up, select \"Open Frame in New Window\" Chrome: right click on the white boarder of the image, from the context menu that pops up, select \"View Frame Source\", remove the string \"view-source\" from the new tab's URL Next, click the play button in the middle of the screen. Then, simply follow the steps in the demonstration guide.

This capability is called Satellite Config. You can learn more about Satellite Config here . Satellite Config is a continuous delivery tool based on the Razee open source project. You can learn more about Razee here . You already learned about Locations and Clusters , but there are additional Satellite key concepts you should be familiar with. They are: Cluster groups A cluster group specifies a set of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters that are registered with the Satellite Config component and that are included in a Satellite configuration. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters that run in your location are automatically registered and can be added to a cluster group. Clusters that run in IBM Cloud must be manually registered with the Satellite Config component before you can add them to a cluster group. Links With Satellite Link endpoints, you can allow software that runs in your Satellite location to connect to a service, server, or application that runs outside of the Satellite Location. Links can also allow software that is connected to the IBM Cloud private network to connect to a service, server, or application that runs in your Satellite Location. To establish the connection, you must specify the destination resource's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address, port, the connection protocol, and any authentication methods at the endpoint. The endpoint is registered with the Satellite Link component of your Location's Satellite control plane. To help you maintain enterprise security and audit compliance, Satellite Link additionally provides built-in controls to restrict client access to endpoints, and to log and audit traffic that flows over endpoints. Satellite Links are not used in these demonstrations but are an important concept to understand. For more information on Links, read the documentation here . Configuration A Satellite configurations, also referred to as Satellite Conifg , is a continuous delivery tool that you can use to consistently roll out versions of your apps across clusters in your Satellite location. For more information, see Deploying Red Hat OpenShift resources across clusters with Satellite configurations . Version A version represents a Kubernetes resource YAML file that you uploaded or manually created for a Satellite configuration. You can include any Kubernetes resource in your version and upload as many versions to a configuration as you like. For help developing a Kubernetes YAML file, see Developing apps to run on OpenShift . Subscription A Satellite subscription is created for a Satellite configuration and specifies which version of the Kubernetes resource that you uploaded is deployed to one or more cluster groups. The Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters in your cluster group can exist in your Satellite Location or in IBM Cloud. Up until now, the demonstrations you have gone through have been focused on creating satellite locations and deploying Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to a Satellite Location. While these are good demonstrations, they do not highlight key business values of IBM Cloud Satellite. In this demonstration, you will learn to demonstrate one of the strong values of IBM Cloud Satellite... the ability to easily deploy and update applications across IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. Info The images in this demonstration guide may differ from what you see when performing the steps. This will typically be due to changes in the IBM Cloud portal user interface, additional objects in lists, etc. These differences should not affect the demonstration. The following acronyms are used throughout this demonstration guide: - YAML - Yet Another Markup Language - AWS - Amazon Web Services","title":"Introduction and terminology"},{"location":"deploy-application/01.02%20The%20Food%20Delivery%20Application/","text":"For this demonstration, we will leverage a sample Food Delivery application. Food Delivery is a cloud native, microservices-based application leveraging multiple cloud native open source projects to develop a simulated version of an UberEATS/Grub Hub type business. The application uses Kafka, Redis, and MongoDB. In this IBM Cloud Satellite demonstration, you will create development and production deployments for the Food Delivery application as illustrated in the diagram below. The application runs on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (a fully managed service). The Satellite Location in AWS will act as the development environment for the application, while production will be in the IBM Cloud data center in Washington, D.C. Notice the production environment is not in a Satellite Location. This illustrates the ability of IBM Cloud Satellite to manage applications not only in Satellite Locations, but also other non-Satellite locations simply by registering the OpenShift cluster with IBM Cloud Satellite. Registering a cluster in this manner is achieved by granting the cluster administrator role to the to the IBM Cloud Satellite Config service. This step has already been performed, but you can learn more about it here . As optional exercises, you can click through the next two demonstrations. The first shows the steps taken to deploy Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud in an IBM Cloud datacenter and the second shows how to register the provisioned OpenShift cluster to IBM Cloud Satellite. Step-by-step directions are not provided for these two demonstrations. Click anywhere on the screen to highlight where to click next if you are not sure. History and Reference This set of assets is based on the material used at the Digital Developer Conference: Hybrid Cloud Labs and the IBM Cloud Community Days Conference. You can reference details on the workshops here: https://anthonyamanse.gitbook.io/ibm-satellite-workshop/ . The base application itself was developed by Yan Koyfam and Anthony Amaranse and published here: https://github.com/IBM/scaling-apps-with-kafka .

View the cluster groups for development and production environments Open your Satellite configuration for the Food Delivery application Create versions to: Deploy Kafka, Mongo, and Redis backends Deploy backend microservices Deploy 2 versions of the application front end Create subscriptions for the cluster groups and versions Verify deployment of the application components Change the application frontend to a new version for the development environment Change the application frontend to a new version for the production environment Rollback the production environment to the original application frontend Remember, the IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS has already been provisioned. In addition, two Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters have been provisioned: one in the Satellite Location and one in another IBM Cloud datacenter. Important Both an IBM Cloud Satellite configuration and an OpenShift project (also known as a namespace) have been created for you. The name for each of these is based upon your IBMid. Your IBMid is not the same as your IBM login. If you do not know your IBMid, you can find it in the IBM Cloud portal by navigating to: https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users , and then selecting your IBM Cloud user identity. You will see your IBMid in the URL for the page that is loaded or by clicking on the Details link at the right of your user page. The format of the IBMid will be similar to: \"IBMid-#######ABC\". The configuration and namespace will be based upon the last part of your IBMid with -ns appended (i.e. #######abc-ns in all lower case to conform to namespace naming rules). In this documentation, we will use #######abc-ns to refer to the configuration and namespace , but you will need to make sure you select the configuration and namespace based upon your IBMid value. Tip How you orchestrate a demonstration for a client will depend on how much time you have for the demonstration, the audience, and your comfort level with the underlying technologies. For instance, if you have a very limited amount to time, you may create the versions before you start the demonstration to save time. If you have a more technical audience, you may want to describe the content of the YAML files that are used. As you walk through the steps in the next section, consider how you would customize the demonstration based upon time, audience, etc.","title":"Demonstration flow"},{"location":"deploy-application/01.04%20Watch%20the%20demonstration/","text":"Before you get started on your own, watch the 12-minute video below that covers this demonstration. The video is based on the steps described in the subsequent sections of this demonstration guide. Callouts and some animations have been included. The screen splitting techniques are recommended, especially if you are doing your demonstration via a web conference. If you have multiple monitors, try putting the demonstration guide browser window on one monitor, and the IBM Cloud portal browser pages on another. During the web conference, just share the monitor with the IBM Cloud portal. Note The location, cluster, and cluster group names used in the video below will differ from the ones you will see in your live environment.","title":"Watch how its done"},{"location":"deploy-application/01.05%20Using%20the%20IBM%20Cloud%20command%20line%20interfaces%20%28CLIs%29/","text":"Important Do not skip this exercise. If you do not complete Step 2 below later parts of the demonstration script are likely to fail. Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are available for IBM Cloud Satellite. In this section, explore the CLI capabilities related to IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. You can learn more about all the IBM Cloud Satellite CLIs here . When doing client demonstrations, it is important to understand who is in your audience. Performing demonstrations of CLIs to a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO) may not be well received; however, this type of demonstration may resonate well with other audiences like members of the IT staff, line-of-business developers, and others. These audiences will want to know that CLIs exist to perform the IBM Cloud Satellite tasks as they will probably want to further automate them in their deployments. In this part of the demonstration, you will use the IBM Cloud Shell. If you are not familiar with IBM Cloud Shell, you can learn about it here . Tip Use the copy capability of the demonstration guide to copy and paste commands to the IBM Cloud Command Shell to avoid typing errors. In the IBM Cloud Portal, with the demonstration account selected ( 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite ), click the IBM Cloud Shell icon. The IBM Cloud Shell will open in a new browser tab or window. It may take a few seconds for the shell to initialize. Synchronize the Role-based access controls (RBAC) for the IBM Cloud Satellite Location's OpenShift cluster. ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster cadlt2tw0qdi2q6casvg Example output OK The configuration for cadlt2tw0qdi2q6casvg was downloaded successfully. Added context for cadlt2tw0qdi2q6casvg to the current kubeconfig file. You can now execute 'kubectl' commands against your cluster. For example, run 'kubectl get nodes'. If you are accessing the cluster for the first time, 'kubectl' commands might fail for a few seconds while RBAC synchronizes. Important The above command forces the RBAC to be synchronized between IBM Cloud and the Red Hat OpenShift cluster running in the IBM Cloud Satellite Location. If this command is not run, issues may be encountered later in this demonstration. List the IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. ibmcloud sat locations Example output Retrieving locations...

In this example, the YAML files used will create OpenShift deployments and routes in the namespace that has been created for you in the respective OpenShift clusters. Four deployment versions will be created: two for the backend services of the application and two different frontends. These deployments will deploy the Kubernetes containers that include the container images and application code. Versions will also be created for the development (dev) and production (prod) environments that will define routes . Routes are used in OpenShift to define communication paths between the end user and the frontend of the application, as well as from the frontend to the backend, and backend to the various backend data stores. Almost all IBM Cloud capabilities can be performed using the IBM Cloud Portal, command line interfaces (CLIs), and application programming interfaces (APIs). In this demonstration, you will use two of these methods to create the versions . First, you will use the IBM Cloud Portal to create the first version that will deploy the backend database (Mongo and Redis) and event stream system (Kafka). Next, you will use the IBM Cloud command line interfaces (CLIs) to create the versions for the backend mirco-services, frontends applications, and the network routes that hook all the components together. If you closed the IBM Cloud portal after the previous step, open the IBM Cloud portal to the Satellite Configurations page: https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/configuration . Click the configuration based on your Demo-UUID . Click the Versions link in left hand menu. Warning Notice, one Version already exists in your configuration. This Version was used to create the OpenShift project where you will be deploying the application. Do NOT delete any existing versions or subscriptions! Deleting them will break your demonstration environment. Click Add version + . Create a version called kafka-mongo-redis . Important Do NOT click the Add button until AFTER you complete step 6!!! For the Version name, use: kafka-mongo-redis Tip To save time, use click the icon in the sections below to copy the text to your clipboard and then paste the text into the IBM Cloud portal as directed. Optionally, enter a description in the Description field.

The YAML editor in the IBM Cloud portal has a search and replace function. Type Ctrl +f or Cmd +f (this will vary depending on your computers operating system). Expand the dialog by clicking the icon next to the entry field. In the first entry field, enter Demo-UUID . In the second entry field, enter your unique Demo-UUID . The dialog should update with a \"1 of 6\" message. Click the replace all icon to make the changes. Click Add . Is the Add button not enabled? If the Add button isn't enabled, there is a problem with your YAML. YAML is very sensitive to formatting. Make sure you cut & paste the YAML instead of entering it manually. Now that we have created a version using the IBM Cloud Portal, in the next section create the other versions using the IBM Cloud command line interfaces. This will save time and illustrate how most clients will automate these steps.","title":"Create versions using IBM Cloud Portal"},{"location":"deploy-application/03.02%20Create%20versions%20using%20command%20line%20interfaces/","text":"Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are available for IBM Cloud Satellite. In this section, explore the CLI capabilities related to IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. You can learn more about all the IBM Cloud Satellite CLIs here . When doing client demonstrations, it is important to understand who is in your audience. Performing demonstrations of CLIs to a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO) may not be well received; however, this type of demonstration may resonate well with other audiences like members of the IT staff, line-of-business developers, and others. These audiences will want to know that CLIs exist to perform the IBM Cloud Satellite tasks as they will probably want to further automate them in their deployments. Overview of IBM Cloud Satellite CLIs In this part of the demonstration, you will use the IBM Cloud Shell. If you are not familiar with IBM Cloud Shell, you can learn about it here . Tip Use the copy capability of the demonstration guide to copy and paste commands to the IBM Cloud Command Shell to avoid typing errors. In the IBM Cloud Portal, with the demonstration account selected ( 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite ), click the IBM Cloud Shell icon. The IBM Cloud Shell will open in a new browser tab or window. It may take a few seconds for the shell to initialize. Synchronize the IBM Cloud portal Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions with the Role-based access controls (RBAC) for the IBM Cloud Satellite Location's OpenShift cluster. Important Do not skip this exercise. If you do not complete this step later parts of the demonstration script are likely to fail. ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster cadlt2tw0qdi2q6casvg Example output OK The configuration for cadlt2tw0qdi2q6casvg was downloaded successfully. Added context for cadlt2tw0qdi2q6casvg to the current kubeconfig file. You can now execute 'kubectl' commands against your cluster. For example, run 'kubectl get nodes'. If you are accessing the cluster for the first time, 'kubectl' commands might fail for a few seconds while RBAC synchronizes. Important The above command forces the RBAC to be synchronized between IBM Cloud and the Red Hat OpenShift cluster running in the IBM Cloud Satellite Location. If this command is not run, issues may be encountered later in this demonstration. List the IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. ibmcloud sat locations Example output Retrieving locations...

In the future, more services will be enabled for IBM Cloud Satellite. In this part of the demonstration, you will learn how to find the IBM Cloud services that are enabled for Satellite using the IBM Cloud portal. In addition, you will see how Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud was provisioned in this demonstration environment, and how you can demonstrate this process. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a fully managed deployment of Red Hat OpenShift that is managed by IBM. In this demonstration environment, the OpenShift cluster has already been deployed to the IBM Cloud Satellite Location running in AWS. In the next chapters, you will learn how this was done and how you can demonstrate this to your client. Note, when originally provisioned, the fully automated process took approximately 45 minutes from start to finish. The cluster that was deployed has 9 worker nodes (labeled as additional hosts in the image below), 3 per availability zone in the Satellite Location. The Satellite Control Plane also acts as the master nodes for this cluster. The logical deployment architecture is depicted below. Note: the public facing IP addresses for both the additional hosts (aka worker nodes) and the satellite control plane hosts in AWS have been exposed for the purposes of this demonstration. For proof-of-concepts (POCs) or production environments, a best practice would be to use the private IP addresses and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to establish connectivity.

Video demonstration This video shows the provisioning of a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS. The video has been edited to minimize the viewing time and does not reflect the actual provisioning time of an OpenShift cluster. The actual provisioning time (from clicking \"Create\" to the clusters being ready) will vary. When this video was created, it took approximately 50 minutes for the cluster to be provisioned in the Satellite location in AWS. Use this video to understand the talking points you can use with a client when describing the provisioning process. Note: If the video appears blurry, click the fullscreen or icon. Click-thru demonstrations Now, give it a try. Use the click-thru script below to step through the demonstration. Now would be a great time to practice what you would say to a client if you were demonstrating the provisioning process. IBM sellers will need to do this as part of your Stand and Deliver to complete the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge. Tip If you are not sure where to click, simply click anywhere on the screen and the spot to click next will be highlighted. The first click-thru demonstration walks you through provisioning the OpenShift cluster with the minimum number of required hosts: 3. In the second click-thru demonstration, you will see how additional hosts can easily be added using the IBM Cloud Portal. Click the play button to begin the demonstration. Click the Clusters option in left pane. Click the Create cluster + button. Click the Satellite tile under the Infrastructure section. Click the Resource group drop down menu.

Practicing for a client demonstration There are several approaches you can take in doing an actual demonstration of the provisioning process of a Satellite enabled IBM Cloud service. Play the above video to the client. It includes both narration and annotations. Use the video and provide your own narration to the video. You will want to pause the video at appropriate locations based upon your narration and any questions your client may have. Use the click-thru demonstrations. Don't try to hide the fact this is a recorded demonstration, rather explain you are using in respect of the client's time as actually provisioning the environment takes about 50 minutes. Alternatively, you could also do this demonstration using the IBM Cloud portal up to the point of clicking the \"Create\" button. Then switch to the already provisioned cluster and describe what took place during the provisioning process. This \"baking show\" approach shows all the steps, but avoids the delays that would be required to perform the provisioning of resources. The steps below can be used as a guide for this style of demonstration. Note, the screen captures below utilize a different location and cluster than what you will have access to, however the instructions should align with what you will see in the IBM Cloud Portal using your IBM Tech Zone reservation. Launch the IBM Cloud portal to the Satellite enabled catalog page: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Asatellite_enabled . Tip The IBM Cloud Portal will be opened in a new browser tab. You need to switch between this tab and the new tab to accomplish many of the tasks. You may want to open the new tab in a new window and display both browser windows at the same time. You may need to disable pop-up blockers if you do not see the new tab. Also, Firefox and Safari browsers are recommended as the image quality of screen captures when viewed in Chrome are sub-optimum. Sample dialog: The current catalog for IBM Cloud Satellite enabled services include IBM Cloud Databases like etcd, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.

In the Location section, select the yl-l3-aws location in the table. Sample dialog: Once I select Satellite, I just need to specify the IBM Cloud Satellite location where I want to deploy OpenShift. As a prerequisite, the Satellite Location will need hosts available for the deployment to succeed. As you will recall, when we created our Satellite Location, we provisioned 3 hosts for the control plane, and 9 hosts as worker nodes. I'll use those 9 hosts as my OpenShift worker nodes, place 3 in each of the 3 availability zones in our Satellite Location. Select Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config and change cluster name to yl-l3-aws-roks-1.

In the Location section, select the yl-l3-aws location in the table. Sample dialog: Once I select Satellite, I just need to specify the IBM Cloud Satellite location where I want to deploy OpenShift. As a prerequisite, the Satellite Location will need hosts available for the deployment to succeed. As you will recall, when we created our Satellite Location, we provisioned 3 hosts for the control plane, and 9 hosts as worker nodes. I'll use those 9 hosts as my OpenShift worker nodes, place 3 in each of the 3 availability zones in our Satellite Location. Select Enable cluster admin access for Satellite Config and change cluster name to yl-l3-aws-roks-1. Important Once you specify a name, the Create button at the far right of the portal would typically be enabled. Since you do not have the appropriate permissions in this account to create a new cluster, the button remains disabled. Now is the time to explain what happens if you were to click create. Sample dialog: That is all the information that is required. Now just click create and let the automated provisioning begin. When I originally provisioned the OpenShift environment in the AWS Satellite Location, it took about 50 minutes for the entire installation and configuration of the OpenShift cluster. Let us now look at an already provisioned cluster in our Satellite location. Click the menu and select Satellite->Clusters . Click yl-l3-aws-roks-1 in the Clusters table. Sample dialog: Here you see the cluster we provisioned and the cluster's current status. Time to wrap up this part of the demonstration. Sample dialog: We can retrieve the details of the cluster and manage it using the IBM Cloud portal as well as the OpenShift web console. From a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud perspective, this cluster is just like any other Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster running in IBM Cloud.","title":"Practicing for a client demonstration"},{"location":"deploy-sat-enabled-services/04.01%20Demonstrate%3A%20Provision%20ROKS%20to%20Sat/","text":"Demonstrating how to provision an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled service may be of interest to some audiences, but this activity is typically done only a couple of times by a client and is usually performed by their technical team. This demonstration does not illustrate the real business value of IBM Cloud Satellite. It is included in this asset for completeness. If you have limited time to perform a live demonstration, you may want to briefly cover this process and move on to some of the other demonstrations described in later parts of the demonstration script. There are several approaches you can take in doing an actual demonstration of the provisioning process of a Satellite enabled IBM Cloud service. Play the video in the previous chapter to the client. It includes both narration and annotations. Use the raw video (below) from the previous chapter and provide your own narration to the video. You will want to pause the video at appropriate locations based upon your narration and any questions your client may have. Info This video has no sound and is intended to be played while you narrate. Also, the IBM Cloud portal and the IBM Cloud Satellite product changes regularly. You may notice some differences between the video and the actual user interface and experience you see today. Note: If the video appears blurry, click the fullscreen or icon. Alternatively, you could also do this demonstration using the IBM Cloud portal up to the point of clicking the \"Create\" button. Then switch to the already provisioned cluster and describe what took place during the provisioning process. This \"baking show\" approach shows all the steps, but avoids the delays that would be required to perform the provisioning of resources. The steps below can be used as a guide for this style of demonstration: Launch the IBM Cloud portal to the Satellite enabled catalog page: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Asatellite_enabled . Tip The IBM Cloud Portal will be opened in a new browser tab. You need to switch between this tab and the new tab to accomplish many of the tasks. You may want to open the new tab in a new window and display both browser windows at the same time. You may need to disable pop-up blockers if you do not see the new tab. Also, Firefox and Safari browsers are recommended as the image quality of screen captures when viewed in Chrome are sub-optimum. Sample dialog: The current catalog for IBM Cloud Satellite enabled services include IBM Cloud Databases like etcd, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ. In addition, IBM Event Streams is available and provides a high-throughput message bus with Apache Kafka. There is also IBM Key Protect for IBM Cloud for managing cryptographic keys for data protection. And we also support Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud as well as Cloud Object Storage.

IBM Cloud Satellite is a managed, distributed cloud solution that delivers cloud services, APIs, access policies, security controls, and compliance. This IBM Technology Sales Enablement demonstration guide is part of the following Your Learning Level 3 learning plans for IBM Cloud Satellite: IBM Sales: https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-37F924EAF756 IBM Technical Sales: Coming Soon Business Partner Sales: https://learn.ibm.com/course/view.php?id=10836 Business Partner Technical Sales: Coming Soon The content here is not meant as a replacement for the Level 1 and 2 content that is part of that learning plan. You should be familiar with IBM Cloud Satellite and should have completed the IBM Cloud Satellite Sales Foundation Badge. This demonstration environment has a dual purpose. First, it is meant to educate you on IBM Cloud Satellite and how to demonstrate some of the capabilities of IBM Cloud Satellite to clients. Second, the environment can be used for actual client demonstrations. After you are familiar with the content, get in front of a client and show the power of IBM Cloud Satellite. Important The focus of the demonstration is on the Infrastructure as a Service capability of IBM Cloud Satellite and not on the specific services deployed to a Satellite Location (for example, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud). Provisioning a Satellite Location on a public cloud like AWS, is automated and typically takes 25-30 minutes depending on the cloud provider, configuration of the servers being used, and other factors. Deploying Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to the Satellite Location usually takes another 30-45 minutes. In addition, to easily access resources on those servers you would need to either create a Virtual Private Network or manually make network configuration changes. This can be time consuming and error prone and will typically take longer than most clients are willing to sit through for a demonstration. In this demonstration asset, an IBM Cloud Satellite environment has already been provisioned for you. In this demonstration environment, you will NOT have full access to the IBM Cloud Satellite capabilities. Your user ID will be restricted to specific capabilities. You will not have permissions to: create new Satellite Locations, Clusters, Cluster Groups, or Configurations deploy new IBM Cloud Services (for example: IBM Cloud Databases, Key Protect, etc.) Warning Attempting to perform an action that you do not have permissions for will result in an error message like the one below. This is not an issue with the IBM Cloud or IBM Cloud Satellite, rather a restriction of the demo environment and the permissions assigned to users. This IBM Cloud Satellite demonstration was built using the IBM TechZone collection: Setup an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS , which can be found here . You may want to leverage this resource to build a custom environment or client Proof-of-Concept (POC). You can also use this collection to perform client demonstrations, but be aware of the time required to provision, configure, and apply configuration changes to have a working environment (minimum 1-2 hours). In this part of the demonstration script, you will explore the provisioning of an IBM Cloud Satellite Location to a public cloud. In this case, AWS is the target public cloud. This initial deployment architecture is illustrated below. In addition to the Satellite location, in this demonstration environment a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud instance has been deployed to the Satellite Location running in AWS. You will explore the deployment of OpenShift and other IBM Cloud Satellite enabled services in Part 2 of this demonstration script.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"environment/02.01%20What%20are%20Locations/","text":"A Satellite Location is a representation of an environment in a client's choice of infrastructure, such as an on-premises data center or public cloud. Creating a Satellite Location can be achieved through the IBM Cloud Portal, via the IBM Cloud Satellite command line interfaces or application programming interfaces (APIs). You create the location using at least three separate network zones in your infrastructure environment and attach host machines across these zones to the Satellite Location. For other public cloud providers, IBM Cloud Satellite provides automation via IBM Cloud Schematics to set up the Location. For on-premises deployments, scripts are provided that will need to be executed on each of the target host machines. You can access the Satellite Locations directly in IBM Cloud Portal through this link: https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/locations Below is a screen capture of the IBM Cloud Portal Satellite Locations page with a single Location defined. Note: the physical location of the Satellite Location is not an attribute of the Location. It is a good practice to use the physical location in the Satellite Location name or tags. To learn more about Satellite Locations, refer to the Satellite Location product documentation: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations . Note: there are many requirements associated with creating a Satellite Location including: minimum host requirements network latency between Satellite Location hosts and IBM Cloud data centers","title":"What are IBM Cloud Satellite Locations"},{"location":"environment/02.02%20Watch%3A%20How%20to%20provision%20a%20Location%20in%20AWS/","text":"In this chapter you will be presented with both a video and a \"click-thru\" demonstration that shows an IBM Cloud Satellite Location being created in AWS. You are strongly encouraged to watch the video first. Then execute the click-thru demonstration and think about what you would say while demonstrating each step to a client. Video demonstration The video below shows the provisioning of an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS. The video has been edited to minimize the viewing time and does not reflect the actual provisioning time of a Satellite Location. The actual provisioning time (from clicking \"Create location\" to the Location being ready) will vary. When this video was created, it took approximately 25 minutes for the 12 hosts to be provisioned in AWS and configured as a Satellite Location. Use this video to understand the talking points you can use with a client when describing the provisioning process. Tip If the video appears blurry, click the fullscreen or icon.

Click the Hosts option in the left pane. Click the Cluster heading in the table of hosts. Click the Overview option in the left pane. Practicing for a client demonstration There are several approaches you can take in doing an actual demonstration of the provisioning process of a Satellite Location: Play the above video. It includes both narration and annotations. Use the the above video and turn off the audio and provide your own narration to the video. You will want to pause the video at appropriate locations based upon your narration and any questions your client may have. Use the click-thru demonstration. Don't try to hide the fact this is a recorded demonstration, rather explain you are using it in respect of the client's time as actually provisioning the environment takes about 30 minutes. Alternatively, you could also do this demonstration using the IBM Cloud portal up to the point of clicking the \"Create location\" button. Then switch to the location view of an already provisioned location and describe what took place during the provisioning process. This \"baking show\" approach shows all the steps, but avoids the delays that would be required to perform the provisioning of resources. Info In this environment, you will not have the AWS credentials to input in the portal to provision an AWS Location. For this type of demo, you can use the \"On-premises & edge\" location template instead of the AWS template and describe the differences based on what you saw in the provisioning video. The steps below can be used as a guide for this style of demonstration: Launch the IBM Cloud portal: https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/overview . Tip The IBM Cloud Portal will be opened in a new browser tab. You need to switch between this tab and the new tab to accomplish many of the tasks. You may want to open the new tab in a new window and display both browser windows at the same time. You may need to disable pop-up blockers if you do not see the new tab. Also, Firefox and Safari browsers are recommended as the image quality of screen captures when viewed in Chrome are suboptimal. Change from your IBM Cloud account to the demonstration IBM Cloud account: 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite *. Tip If your browser window is narrow, you may see this icon: instead of the current account name as shown in the screen capture above. If you do not see the 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite listed, verify you accepted the invitation from IBM Cloud to join the account and that your IBM Technology Zone environment is active. Click Create a Satellite Location . Describe the Location templates page. Sample dialog: IBM Cloud Satellite Locations can be anywhere. IBM provides templates for several public cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. The public cloud provider templates automate the provisioning of the remote compute, memory, and storage resources. After the servers are provisioned, the automation deploys the IBM Cloud Satellite control plane software, configures the environment, and puts it under the management of IBM Cloud site reliability engineers (SREs). Click the On-premises & edge tile. Click the Edit link. Sample dialog: For on-premises deployments or to other public cloud providers, the process has a few more manual steps. You will want to provide a descriptive name and any tags to better identify the Location. You will also need to select the Managed from location. This is the IBM Cloud data center that will be used to manage the Satellite Location. You will want to select the IBM Cloud data center that is nearest to your Satellite Location as there are latency requirements. In addition, you can specify the names of availability zones within your Satellite Location. Ideally, you will provision servers in separate physical zones to provide high availability to your cloud services. And finally, you will need to provide an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance that will be used for backups of the IBM Cloud Satellite control plane. After that is complete, click Create location . This will create a script that you will then need to download, install, and run on each of the servers in the Satellite Location. The script will download the IBM Cloud Satellite control plane software, install, configure, and put the Satellite Location under IBM's control. Click the Locations link at top left of screen. Sample dialog: After the Satellite Location is fully deployed, you can access the details of the Location. Here you see the current Satellite Locations that have been deployed, their state, and additional information. Let us look at the details of one of these. Click yl-l3-aws . Important The actual details may differ from the screen capture above. You will want to adjust your dialog to what you see. Sample dialog: Here we see the details and status of the Satellite Location. Notice we have 12 hosts at this Location, and they are all currently in the assigned state. Typically, when a Satellite Location is first provisioned, you will see 3 hosts assigned and the others in the unassigned state. The first 3 hosts are used for the IBM Cloud Satellite control plane. Additional hosts are used to deploy IBM Cloud Services like managed Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud Databases. Click Hosts . Sort the table by clicking the Cluster menu item in the table header. Sample dialog: Here we see the details for each host that has been deployed at our Satellite Location. Notice the Status and Availability fields. In this Location, we see that we have our 3 Control plane hosts and the other 9 are used by a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. These 9 hosts are the worker nodes in our Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Click the Attach host button. Sample dialog: If we want to add additional hosts to the Satellite Location, we can do so by going here and specifying the tags we want to use to label the host and then downloading the configuration script. At this time, there is not automation for adding additional hosts to an existing Location, so we will need to provision the hardware, download the configuration script, and run the script. After that is complete, the host will be moved under IBM management and appear as a new host at our Location in a \"unassigned\" state. Click Cancel . Sample dialog: That is a brief overview of how to provision an IBM Cloud Satellite Location. We will cover services, link endpoints, and other IBM Cloud Satellite capabilities later.

Once that is complete, you click \"Create location\". This will create a script that you will then need to download, install, and run on each of the servers in the Satellite Location. The script will download the IBM Cloud Satellite control plane software, install, configure, and put the Satellite Location under IBM's control. Click the Locations link at top left of screen. Sample dialog: Once the Satellite Location is fully deployed, you can access the details of the Location. Here you see the current Satellite Locations that have been deployed, their state, and additional information. Let us look at the details of one of these. Click yl-l3-aws . Important The actual details may differ from the screen capture above. You will want to adjust your dialog to what you see. Sample dialog: Here we see the details and status of our Satellite Location. Notice we have 12 hosts at this Location, and they are all currently in the \"assigned\" state. Typically, when a Satellite Location is first provisioned, you will see 3 hosts assigned and the others in the unassigned state. The first 3 hosts are used for the IBM Cloud Satellite control plane. Additional hosts are used to deploy IBM Cloud Services like managed Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud Databases. Click Hosts . Sort the table by clicking the Cluster menu item in the table header. Sample dialog: Here we see the details for each host that has been deployed at our Satellite Location. Notice the Status and Availability fields. In this Location, we see that we have our 3 Control plane hosts and the other 9 are used by a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. These 9 hosts are the worker nodes in our Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Click the Attach host button. Sample dialog: If we want to add additional hosts to the Satellite Location, we can do so by going here and specifying the tags we want to use to label the host and then downloading the configuration script. At this time, there is not automation for adding additional hosts to an existing Location, so we will need to provision the hardware, download the configuration script, and run the script. Once complete, the host will be moved under IBM management and appear as a new host at our Location in a \"unassigned\" state. Click Cancel . Sample dialog: That is a brief overview of how to provision an IBM Cloud Satellite Location. We will cover services, link endpoints, and other IBM Cloud Satellite capabilities later.

The IBM account team has scheduled a half day virtual session to give the client an overview of IBM Cloud. In attendance will be: the Chief Information Officer (CIO) the head of the Infrastructure Technology (IT) technical architects from the IT organization technical architects from various Lines of Business (LoBs) that are interested in moving their applications to \"the cloud\" We only have 30 minutes on a very tight agenda and have been instructed to leave time for questions at the end. We will be following a brief presentation a colleague is doing on the benefits of IBM Cloud Satellite using the IBM Cloud Satellite Client Deck. The slot on our agenda is titled \"IBM Cloud Satellite: Live Demonstration\". The goals for the demonstration are: Show how easy it is to deploy IBM Cloud Satellite to a public cloud provider Show how easy it is to deploy an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled services Show how IBM Cloud Satellite can be used to deploy and manage a cloud native application to remote data centers Given the limited amount of time we are allotted, we have decided to leverage an existing environment that already has a Satellite Location deployed with Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. We will use a \"baking show\" approach in our demonstration and focus the majority of our time on the ease of application deployment and management using IBM Cloud Satellite config.","title":"02.01 The Big Event"},{"location":"prepping-for-a-demo/03.01%20Setting%20up%20for%20the%20virtual%20demo/","text":"Quote Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. Alexander Graham Bell Don't wait to the last minute. Make sure the IBM TechZone environment you need is up and running the day before the event and will be available for at least one additional day in case someone wants a follow-up. Setup all the tools you will need before hand. Given this event will be virtual, make sure everything works with the e-meeting technology you will be using (i.e. WebEx, Zoom, etc). Quote Practice makes perfect. Benjamin Franklin Make sure you practice the demonstration flow. There is nothing more embarrassing than a demonstration that fails. Know the steps you are going to take. Know what you will say. Plan on handling errors that may occur. If you are using the \"baking show\" approach, make sure you practice what you will say in the transition from canceling out of doing an actual creation of a resource to moving to a fully provisioned instance of the resource. And most importantly, practice, practice, practice .
