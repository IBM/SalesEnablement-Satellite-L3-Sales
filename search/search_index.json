This capability is called Satellite Config. Learn more about Satellite Config here. Satellite Config is a continuous delivery tool based on the Razee open source project. Learn more about Razee here.</p> <p>To fully understand and use Satellite Config it is important to know a few more terms:</p> <ul> <li>Clusters</li> </ul> <p>The previous chapter discussed deploying a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster to a Satellite Location and how during that process the option to enable Satellite Config to access that cluster. In addition, IBM Cloud Satellite provides the ability for Satellite Config to access other OpenShift cluster's running on IBM Cloud. This is accomplished by manually registering the cluster with Satellite Config. </p> <p>Registering clusters is a two step process. The first is to register the cluster with Satellite Config through the IBM Cloud Portal or command line interface. This will create a record in the Satellite Config configuration data store (ConfigMap) and generate a command line that will need to be executed on the OpenShift cluster. Step 2, a user with administrative privileges on the OpenShit cluster will need to execute the generated command line. The command creates the razeedeploy project, custom resource definitions, and role-based access control (RBAC) policies on the cluster that are required to make the cluster visible to Satellite Config.</p> <ul> <li>Cluster groups</li> </ul> <p>A cluster group specifies a set of OpenShift clusters that are registered with Satellite Config. A cluster group consists of one or more registered clusters that can reside in different Satellite Locations or IBM Cloud.</p> <ul> <li>Configuration</li> </ul> <p>A Satellite configuration, also referred to as Config, is a continuous delivery tool that is used to consistently roll out versions of Kubernetes resources across cluster groups. For more information, see Deploying Red Hat OpenShift resources across clusters with Satellite configurations.</p> <ul> <li>Version</li> </ul> <p>A version represents a Kubernetes resource file that is uploaded or manually created in a Config. The version can include any Kubernetes resource definition and a configuration can have any number of versions. Kubernetes uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) for resource files. For help developing a Kubernetes YAML resource file, see Developing apps to run on OpenShift.</p> <ul> <li>Subscription</li> </ul> <p>A Satellite subscription is created for a Config and specifies which version of the Kubernetes resource is to be deployed to one or more cluster groups. </p> <ul> <li>Source repository</li> </ul> <p>A source repository can be thought of as a datastore for different resource definitions (like a version) of YAML files (and more). Satellite Config supports both GitHub and GitLab as source repositories. In this activity, GitHub is used as the source repository.</p> <p>Satellite Config supports two models for creating configurations. One is a GitOps-based configuration which utilizes a source repository. GitOps is an operational framework that takes Development and Operations (DevOps) best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and applies them to infrastructure automation. The other is a Direct Upload model where a version file is created or uploaded directly into the configuration via the IBM Cloud Portal or command line utilities.</p> <p>In this activity, the focus will be on the GitOps-based model. Subscriptions will be created in a configuration that will deploy resources stored in GitHub. After an initial deployment, if the resources change in GitHub, they are automatically deployed by Satellite Config. This process is illustrated in the diagram below.</p> <p></p> <p>This demonstration using GitHub is borrowed from the Deploying apps to clusters with Satellite Config tutorial in the IBM Cloud Satellite documentation.</p> <p>Before creating a configuration using the Satellite Config GitOps model, a source repository will need to be created along with a sample application.</p>"},{"location":"3config/03.02%20SetupGitHub/","title":"Setup GitHub repository","text":"<p>Before proceeding</p> <p>A reservation for the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment must be available and in the Ready state before proceeding.

The namespace value is found on the ITZ reservation page (see the example below) or in the e-mail sent by ITZ for the reservation. The value will be in the format \"######ABCD-se-l3\". In the images below \"2700039nft-se-l3\" are used, but you must use your specific namespace value in order to successfully complete this exercise.</p> Why am I doing this? <p>Because the ITZ environment is shared by all users of this demonstration guide, a common namespace cannot be used or else users would overwrite each other and cause issues when attempting to follow the instructions. Each ITZ reservation sets up a unique namespace for each user. By changing this value in the deployment YAML files for the sample application, each user is able to deploy their own copy of the application in the OpenShift clusters managed by IBM Cloud Satellite.</p> <p>Sample ITZ reservation page:</p> <p></p> <p>Sample ITZ e-mail:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the 1-helloworld-namespace.yaml file in the deployments directory.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Edit the file by clicking the pencil  icon.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Change the value of the name field to the name of your ITZ-created namespace, remove the name: satellite-config-sample line under the labels section, and add the line deploy.razee.io/mode: \"EnsureExists\" under the labels section as shown below.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Formatting in YAML is important</p> <p>The YAML language is very sensitive to formatting. Make sure each line aligns as illustrated in the image above. Use spaces and not tabs (2 spaces before name: and labels: and 4 spaces before deploy.razee.io/mode:).</p> <p>Because the namespace is already created for you by the ITZ reservation, the deploy.razee.io/mode: \"EnsureExists\" label tells Satellite config to ignore this step if the namespace already exists. </p> <ol> <li>Click Commit changes....</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Update the Commit message text field with an appropriate message and then click the Commit changes button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click deployments to navigate back to the list of YAML files.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Next, the other three (3) YAML files need to be updated. For each of these, only the namespace field needs to be updated. The next set of steps walk you through updating one of the files, but you must do it for all three files:</p> <ul> <li>2-helloworld-deployment.yaml</li> <li>3-helloworld-route.yaml</li> <li>4-helloworld-svc.yaml</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Click the 2-helloworld-deployment.yaml file name.</li> <li>Edit the file by clicking the pencil  icon. </li> <li>Change the namespace field from satellite-config-sample to your ITZ specific namespace value.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Do not use 2700039nft-se-l3</p> <p>You must use the namespace name created specifically for you as shown in your ITZ reservation!</p> <ol> <li>Click the Commit changes... button.</li> <li>Update the Commit message text field with an appropriate message and then click the Commit changes button.</li> <li>Click deployments to navigate back to the list of YAML files.</li> </ol> <p>Repeat steps 13-18 for each of the other 2 files in the deployments directory:</p> <ul> <li>3-helloworld-route.yaml</li> <li>4-helloworld-svc.yaml</li> </ul> <p>For this demonstration, 2 branches in GitHub are used: config-sample-dev and config-sample-prod. The changes just made in the config-sample-dev branch need to be made in the config-sample-prod branch as well. This can be done manually using the steps above, or a pull request can be completed to copy all changes from one branch to the other. This process will be used in the demonstration as well, so instead of manually making the changes, practice doing a pull request.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Pull requests link at the top of the GitHub page.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the New pull request button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Change the base repository field from IBM/satellite-config-example to your GitHub fork of the repository.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Select your repository fork!!!</p> <p>The default selection is the original IBM/satellite-config-example. You MUST select your repository instead of the default or \"andrewjones-tx/satellite\".</p> <ol> <li>Change the base field from main to *config-sample-prod and the compare field from main to config-sample-dev*.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>This will tell GitHub to pull all changes in the *config-sample-dev branch into the config-sample-prod* branch.</p> <ol> <li>Verify the pull request can be merged, and click Create pull request.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Enter a comment for the request and click Create pull request.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Review the changes that are being made with the pull request and click Merge pull request.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click Confirm merge to perform the merging of the dev and prod branches.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Verify the changes in the prod branch.</p> <ol> <li>Click the &lt;&gt; Code link and then change the branch pulldown menu to config-sample-prod.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Notice the status above the table. It should reflect the recent merge of the pull request. The changes can also be viewed by clicking the deployments directory and viewing the individual YAML files.</p> <p></p> <p>To summarize, at this point a copy (fork) of the sample code was made to your personal repository. Updates to the associated YAML files were made to work in the shared ITZ environment for this activity. </p> <ol> <li>Before proceeding, copy and record the URL for your repository.

The following demonstration scripts are split to align with two of the key values of IBM Cloud Satellite and to separate out the required elements of the Stand and Deliver for IBM Sales and Technical Sales roles.</p> <p>The first demonstration is focused on the ease of extending IBM Cloud Satellite to a remote location like a 3rd party cloud provider, client on-premises data center, or an edge location, and deploying satellite-enabled IBM Cloud services. This demonstration is like a baking show. The steps to create resources (unbaked) is shown, but instead of waiting for them to provision, the demonstration will shift to using already provisioned (baked) resources. This style of demonstration is used because the process to provision a Satellite Location typically takes 30 minutes or more and significant resources are required. </p> <p>The second demonstration continues from the first to show the capabilities of Satellite Config. In this demonstration, a sample application will be deployed using Satellite Config to remote locations and  automatically managed through a GitOps model of application development and operations (DevOps).</p> <p>Each of the following sections provides step-by-step instructions for walking through the above scenarios. Following those steps is the easy part. The harder part of a demonstration is describing and relating the value of what is being done to the client. Sample talking points are provided. In addition, demonstration video of both parts is provided at the end. </p> <p>All sellers should practice their demonstrations several times before performing a live client demonstration or recording their Stand and Delivers. Be prepared for things to go wrong! How would you handle these scenarios?</p> What if the network used to connect to the IBM Cloud portal fails? <p>Try using an alternative network like a cell phone's hot spot. Have a recording of a practice session available that can be used in a worse case scenario.</p> What if the IBM Technology Zone environment reservation expires? <p>Don't let this happen! Make sure the life of the reservation is at least a day after the planned demonstration. This will also provide an opportunity to retrace the demonstration to help remember any client questions that may not have been captured during the actual demonstration.</p> What if the presenter before runs long and the demonstration time is cut from 30 minutes to 15 minutes? <p>Sadly, this is very common. Time management during a demonstration is critical. Be prepared to jump to parts of the demonstration that will most resonate with the audience. Have browser windows preloaded to key interfaces (e.g. IBM Cloud Portal, OpenShift web console, etc.) minimize loading time. Interactive discussions are great, but make sure questions and answers don't impact completing the demonstration. Some questions are best deferred til after the demonstration is complete.</p> <p>And make sure common presentation best practices are followed like:</p> <ul> <li>Remove distractions. Mute cell phones, Slack, and anything else that may interrupt the demonstration.</li> <li>For virtual demonstrations, verify the audience is seeing what they should be seeing.</li> <li>Know what you know, and know what you don't know. If the client asks a question that you can't answer respond with \"Let me get back to you on that.\" And then make sure you do! Don't dance, don't guess. </li> <li>Know your audience! Understanding who each person is and their roles will allow the demonstrator to relate what is being shown to the individuals. Understand the clients business and industry so the messaging can be customized to their business problems.</li> </ul> <p>Next, follow and learn a prepared script for performing a high-level demonstration of IBM Cloud Satellite that shows how easy it is to deploy a Location and Satellite-enabled services to Satellite locations.</p>"},{"location":"4demo/04.02%20GeneralDemo/","title":"High level demonstration of IBM Cloud Satellite","text":"<p>The following steps assume all of the prior sections of this activity have been completed. </p> <ol> <li>Login to the IBM Cloud portal here: https://cloud.ibm.com and change to the 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>If introductions have not already been done, now is the time. If the client is not an existing IBM Cloud user, then provide some high level statements about IBM Cloud (e.g. world wide coverage, 300 cloud based services including fully managed Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, etc.).</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to the Satellite Overview page.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>If earlier discussions were not focused on IBM Cloud Satellite, describe the offering and its values. Leverage the talking points from the IBM Cloud Satellite Client Presentation (from the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 2 learning plan). The overview provides some useful descriptions on three topics that will be covered: IBM Cloud services, application management, and network traffic management.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Create Location + button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>If it is known the client uses a specific cloud provider, focus on that specific provider and how IBM Cloud Satellite provides automated, terraform-based scripts to both provision the remote resources as well as deploying the control plane resources for a Satellite Location. </p> <p>In lieu of the next steps which use the Advanced configuration option, consider creating an account in one of the 3rd party clouds and using those credentials to show the Satellite location provisioning page (see image below for how it looks in AWS). Alternatively, the video in the Provisioning chapter can be used as part of the demonstration to show the process for a Location in AWS.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the Advanced configuration tile.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Notice there is very little information required to create a Satellite location. As learned earlier, the real provisioning work is done by the attach host script that are generated for the location which is executed on each of the physical servers. This will be explored shortly. The key fields on the location creation screen are the Managed from, zone names, Red Hat CoreOS Support, and an object storage bucket.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Managed from pull down option.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>When provisioning a Satellite location, clients should choose the IBM Cloud datacenter that is nearest to the physical servers in the remote location. The hosts attached to the Satellite location control plane must have a low latency connection of less than or equal to 200 milliseconds (&lt;= 200ms) round-trip time (RTT) to the IBM Cloud region that the Satellite location is managed from. Learn more about this requirement here.</p> <p>Depending on the audience, discuss the following topics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Zones - The Zone fields allow the user to specify names used for the network availability zones where control plane and worker nodes will be assigned. High availability (HA) is a key to keeping applications up and running, even after a partial or full site failure. The main purpose of high availability is to eliminate potential points of failures in an infrastructure. </p> </li> <li> <p>Red Hat CoreOS - Enabling Red Hat CoreOS support comes with both pros and cons. A Red Hat CoreOS enabled location unlocks more features such as minimal outbound network requirements, HTTP proxy for outbound traffic, OpenShift virtualization, and single node cluster topology. But it has a higher infrastructure requirement. On the other hand, a non-CoreOS enabled location supports a smaller feature set but can run at a smaller footprint, allowing more clusters per same capacity. For more information about the key benefits of CoreOS, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS.</p> </li> <li> <p>IBM Cloud Object Storage - An object storage bucket is required to store data about the Satellite location&gt; and backups of the OpenShift clusters. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Once all the required information is provided, a user would click Create location. Users of this IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment will NOT have permission to create a location. Inform the client that creating a Satellite location using the advanced configuration method only takes a few minutes, where as using one of the automated approaches for 3rd party cloud providers will take longer as the actual servers are provisioned in the client's account and the host attach scripts are executed. </p> <ol> <li>Click the Locations bread crumb trail at the top of the Advanced configuration page.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inform the audience that a pre-provisioned location will be used to show how hosts are added to the location.</p> <ol> <li>Enter yl-l3 in the Locations table search bar and then click the yl-l3-empty-location entry.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The Setting up your new location provides the basic flow for adding hosts and setting up the location.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Hosts link in left-hand menu.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The next step is to add a host to the location. As mentioned earlier, this involves downloading a host attach script and executing that script on each server that is to be added to the location.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Attach host + button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>In this ITZ environment, access is not provided to generate the script or download the script. If there is a very technical audience, a sample script is located here that can be downloaded and displayed. Continuing with the baking show approach, now show a location that already has hosts attached.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Locations bread crumb trail at the top of the hosts page.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Enter yl-l3 in the Locations table search bar and then click the yl-l3-vmware entry.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The overview page for a Satellite location provides general information about the location and the location's health. </p> <ol> <li>Click the Hosts link in left-hand menu.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>On the Hosts notice that 12 hosts have been added to this location. Initially when added, the host's Availability would be listed as Unassigned. The next step for creating the location would be to assign a minimum of 3 hosts to the Control plane. Control plane hosts do not run any client workloads, rather the location control plane runs resources that are managed by IBM to manage the hosts, clusters, and other resources that you attach to the location. Sizing of the control plane is an important exercise that needs be done early in the planning phase, but keep in mind additional hosts can be added to the control plane at any time by running the attach host script on new servers.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Services link in left-hand menu.</li> </ol> <p>IBM Cloud Satellite provides clients the ability to run Satellite-enabled services at remote locations. As seen here, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, an IBM-managed deployment of OpenShift, has already been deployed at this location. Let's explore how this was done.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Create services + button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>There are several Satellite-enabled services available in the IBM Cloud catalog and can be easily deployed to a Satellite location. Take a few minutes to highlight each of the available services and the capabilities they provide.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud tile.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides an IBM managed environment for running Kubernetes resources. These could be client applications and/or IBM offerings like IBM Cloud Paks. As a Satellite-enabled service, the deployment of OpenShift is fully automated. </p> <p>Using the Red Hat OpenShift cluster deployment page, describe the required parameters for the deployment. The key fields to highlight are the Location, number of worker nodes, OpenShift version, licensing, and Satellite Config enablement.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Location - The location is pre-selected since the request was to add a service to the yl-l3-vmware location. </p> </li> <li> <p>Worker pool - These settings allow users to specify what availability zones should be used and now many worker nodes should be deployed to each zone as well as the number of virtual CPUs (vCPU) and memory for each worker node. Sizing of the worker pool is a critical activity. Hosts can be added and removed, but it is important to size the pool based upon the planned workloads.</p> </li> <li> <p>OpenShift version - There will typically be 3-4 versions of OpenShift available. As new versions are made available by Red Hat, the older versions will roll off of the selectable list. While Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a managed service, there are client responsibilities which include updating the worker nodes. This will be discussed again later.</p> </li> <li> <p>Licensing - OpenShift licensing can be added here or Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager can be used by the client to manage the OpenShift licenses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Satellite Config - Satellite config can be enabled for the cluster now, or later by running the register cluster script as described earlier in this activity.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Notice the warning that the Minimum host requirements are not met message is displayed. This is due to the fact all the hosts in the location are already utilized. Hosts must be available and in the Unassigned state in order for a new service to be deployed to the location.</p> <p>Once all the required parameters are provided, the Create button would be enabled and the automated deployment could be started. Note, the deployment of OpenShift in this ITZ environment took approximately 30 minutes to complete.</p> <p>When the OpenShift tile was clicked, this provisioning dialog opened in a new browser tab or window. Close this window and return to the Location Services page.</p> <ol> <li>Click the x at top right.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the Link endpoints link in left-hand menu.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>As described earlier, Link endpoints are used to control and audit network traffic between the IBM Cloud Satellite location and services, servers, and applications that run outside of the location.</p> <p>IBM Cloud Satellite provides clients the ability to integrate with IBM Cloud logging, monitoring, and activity tracking to Link endpoints. These integrations are outside of the scope of this demonstration and access to the dashboards are not provided for this ITZ environment, rather is used by ITZ to monitor and managed the shared environment.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Create endpoint + button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>There are two types of Link endpoints as described in the earlier chapter on Link endpoints. A Satellite location endpoint specifies that the destination resource runs on a cluster or host in the Satellite location, whereas a Cloud endpoint specifies that the destination resources run in IBM Cloud. </p> <p>Depending on the audience and technical comfort with the topic, click the Next button to walk through the information required to create an endpoint. If details are not required, simply describe the Link endpoint as a networking rule that allows in and outbound access over a secure tunnel between the resources at the Satellite location and the outside world over the Internet.</p> <p>The other important resource at a Satellite location is storage. The access controls in this ITZ environment does not provide access to this page in the IBM Cloud portal. Storage configurations. In addition to the storage that may be directly associated with the worker nodes added to a location, additional storage may also be added to the location and made available to the clusters and resources running in the Satellite location. Templates are available for 3rd party cloud storage types (AWS, Azure, Google), various IBM System Storage types, NetApp storage systems, VMware, and OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF). Additionally, Satellite supports bring-your-own storage drivers installed using the OpenShift Catalog, OperatorHub, Helm charts, or by deploying images to the clusters that include the required storage drivers. For more information on Satellite storage read Understanding Satellite storage.</p> <p>At this point, the creation of a IBM Cloud Satellite location and the deployment of a Satellite-enabled service (Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud) has been demonstrated. Next, follow and learn how to demonstrate the power of IBM Cloud Satellite Config to automate the deployment of Kubernetes services to OpenShift clusters managed by IBM Cloud Satellite.</p>"},{"location":"4demo/04.03%20DeployDemo/","title":"Satellite Config demonstration","text":"<p>Now it is time to demonstrate the power of Satellite config.

Make sure all spacing and quotes remain the same. Any string can be used in stead of \"1.2\". The value just needs to be different in order for GitHub to notice the change.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Commit changes... button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>To see Satellite config in action, complete the next two steps without a long delay between the two. Satellite config runs subscriptions approximately every 5 minutes. When performing a client demonstration, consider building talking points into the time between the next two steps.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Commit changes button in the pop-up dialog. Optionally, modify the Commit message text entry field.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Return to the OpenShift web console for the yl-l3-ibm-roks-2 cluster (development) and click the middle of the helloworld-app.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>A side window will open with the details of the sample application's deployment.</p> <p></p> <p>Now observe the two highlighted sections. Several things will be occurring, as seen in the animation below. First Satellite config, at its ~5 minute interval, will notice a change in the GitHub repository for the config-sample-dev repository. It will then process the YAML files just as it did when the subscription was first run. This will deploy the updated 2-helloworld-deployment.yaml to the OpenShift cluster. In OpenShift, as illustrated in the animated give below, a new pod will be created with executing the new deployment with the changes made. This creates a new instance of the application. Once the new pod is running, the old pod is deleted. This process prevents downtime.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the route link  icon to open the web page front end to the deployed application in the **yl-l3-ibm-roks-2 cluster.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Notice the string displayed should reflect the change made from the edit of the 2-helloworld-deployment.yaml.</p> <p></p> Still seeing 1.1? <p>Make sure at least 5 minutes has passed from when the code was changed in GitHub. After 5 minutes, click the deployment route link in the OpenShift web console, or refresh the browser page where the Hello World application is running.</p> <p>As part of the DevOps process, the next step after modifying and testing any changes made is to perform a pull request from the config-sample-dev to the config-sample-prod. Once the pull request is merged in GitHub, the Satellite config for the **se-l3-production cluster group will be processed. </p> <ol> <li>Switch to the browser tab for the config-sample-prod cluster and verify the sample application is still at version 1.1.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Switch to the GitHub browser tab and click the Pull request link.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the New pull request button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Change the base repository pull-down to your repository.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Change the base branch to config-sample-prod and the compare branch to **config-sample-dev.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the Create pull request button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Once again, click the Create pull request button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the Merge pull request button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Click the Confirm merge button.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Now that the merge has been performed in GitHub, the changes will be propagated to the se-l3-production cluster group via the Satellite config subscription.</p> <ol> <li>Return to the OpenShift web console for the yl-l3-vmware-roks-1 cluster (production) and click the middle of the helloworld-app.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>A side window will open with the details of the sample application's deployment.</p> <p></p> <p>Just as observed with the development copy of the sample application, the production copy will be updated. A new pod will be created and the old one will be removed. It may take a full 5 minutes before the update occurs.</p> <ol> <li>Click the route link  icon to open the web page front end to the deployed application in the yl-l3-vmware-roks-1 cluster.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Notice the string displayed should reflect the change made from the edit of the 2-helloworld-deployment.yaml.</p> <p></p> <p>That concludes to demonstration of Satellite config and how it can be used in conjunction with GitHub and a DevOps process.</p> <p>Continue to the next section to learn how to complete the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 learning plan.</p>"},{"location":"4demo/04.04%20WatchDemo/","title":"Watch a recorded demonstration example","text":"<p>The video below walks through the demonstration scenarios outlined in the previous two chapters and highlights the features and values of IBM Cloud Satellite covered in this activity. This example does not follow the first scenario step-by-step, rather the presenter chooses to utilize the videos from the chapter on provisioning a location. Both methods can be affective.</p> <p>In this mock client presentation, the presenter utilizes several assets available in this demonstration guide including:</p> <ul> <li>the high level architecture diagrams shown in \"The environment\" and \"Deploy a web app using Sat Config\" chapters</li> <li>the two (2) video demonstrating provisioning a Satellite location in AWS and a location using the manual process</li> </ul> <p>These assets were downloaded locally via the web browser by right clicking on the asset and selecting the download option. Both were pre-loaded in an appropriate viewer.</p> <p>Additionally the presenter preloaded most of the web pages that are accessed as part of the demonstration including:</p> <ul> <li>IBM Cloud Portal</li> <li>Red Hat OpenShift web console for both the yl-l3-vmware-roks-1 (production) and the yl-l3-ibm-roks-2 (development) clusters.</li> <li>GitHub repository</li> </ul> <p>Preloading these pages saves time and allows the presentation to flow smoother by prearranging the browser windows and tabs.
